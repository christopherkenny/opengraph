The goal of `opengraph` is to read and process Open Graph Protocol HTML on websites.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `opengraph` from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages('pak')
pak::pak('christopherkenny/opengraph')
```

## Example

This is a relatively simple package. 
The main function is `og_parse()` which returns a named vector of Open Graph metadata found on a given webpage.

```{r parse}
library(opengraph)
url <- 'https://christophertkenny.com/opengraph/'
og_parse(url)
```

The package can also read specific Open Graph properties with `og_property()`.
Properties can be prefixed with `og:` or not.

```{r property}
og_property(url, 'og:title')
og_property(url, 'title')
```

If there is no Open Graph metadata found, `og_parse()` will return an empty named vector.

```{r none}
og_parse('https://cran.r-project.org/')
```
