Description: Social media sites often embed link cards when links are shared, based
    on metadata in the Open Graph Protocol. This supports extracting that metadata
    from a website. It further allows for the creation of tags to add to a website
    to support the Open Graph Protocol and provides a list of the most common tags and
    their required properties.
