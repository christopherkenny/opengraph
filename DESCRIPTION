Description: Social media sites often embed cards when links are shared, based on
    metadata in the 'Open Graph Protocol' (<https://ogp.me/>). This supports extracting
    that metadata from a website. It further allows for the creation of tags to
    add to a website to support the 'Open Graph Protocol' and provides a list of the
    standard tags and their required properties.
